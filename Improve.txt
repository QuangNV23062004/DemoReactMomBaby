Blog can be changed from productID to category:
        + Now we have 1 attribute productID, which only contain 1 product...
        + We can changed it to category since the product table also have category
        + Compare those 2 table and select product.category === blog.category

Can add 1 extra table named batch(or something like that): for expirationDate
        + Batch will have info like dateImport, productID, productQuantity, expirationDate
        + When batch is added add the quantity of that batch to the quantity in product API(total quantity of that product)
        + When a product is sell get all batch and sort them by expirationDate, update quantity in both oldest batch(to know which batch from) and product API(new total quantity)
